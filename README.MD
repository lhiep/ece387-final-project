<h3 align="center">ECE 387 Final Project Written Proposal</h3>
<h3 align="center">By Hiep Le</h3>

### GOALS
The goal of this project is to construct a sensor that can be easily attached to any gym equipments with linear motion components (such as weights). The sensor then will send signals caused by the motion of the equipment, such as lifting weight, to a connected phone. With a custom made game app, the user can use any gym equipment to play the game. This will encourage the user to use the gym more often, helps the user from getting bored while working out, and helps the user to forget how tired he/she is.

### HARDWARE
- An wifi/bluetooth capable ESP8266 board attached to an ultrasonic sensor that detects up/down movements and sends signal a phone.

### SOFTWARE
- A custom-made app with 1 or more game(s) to play using the signals from the ESP8266 board.

### PRELIMINARY PLAN
This project will be composed of 4 stages:

- Collecting parts - parts can be bought, borrowed, or already owned.
- Prototyping - a prototype can be made on a breadboard, testing for functionality and feasibility.	
    - Hardware design - Connecting components together on breadboard.
    - Software design - Arduino/ESP8266 programming.
    - App design - Android/iOS app programming.
- Final product - The final product is constructed based on the prototype.
    - Hardware design - Soldering components on PCB.
    - Software design - Arduino/ESP8266 programming.
    - App design - Android/iOS app programming.
- Testing & modifications - the product will be thoroughly tested and modified as necessary.
    - Does it work as intended? If not, whatâ€™s wrong?
    - Is the delay between the sensor and the app short enough for the game to be played? If not, how can this be improved?
    - Does the app work as intended? If not, how can it be fixed?
